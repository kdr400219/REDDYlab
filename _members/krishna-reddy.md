Krishna obtained his undergraduate degree in Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida, where he studied microbial adaptations in freshwater rivers with Dr. Andrew Ogram. He then received his PhD at the University of South Florida in the labs of Dr. Robert Deschenes and Dr. Vladimir Uversky, where he studied palmitoylation enzymes and substrates using a combination of bioinformatics, yeast genetics, and biochemistry. Krishna also had a brief stint as an NSF EAPSI graduate fellow in the lab of Dr. Masaki Fukata, where he studied membrane trafficking of palmitoyltransferases in primary neurons. 

As a NIH NRSA postdoctoral fellow (and subsequently Instructor) in the lab of [Dr. Olga Boudker](https://www.boudkerlab.com/), Krishna studied the structure, function, and dynamics of glutamate transporters. He later became interested in how molecular evolution could inform deeper understanding of transporter structure-function, applying ancestral protein reconstruction to the evolution of ion coupling in glutamate transporters. In 2025, he returned to the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of South Florida to start his independent group.
